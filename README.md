# Django-forum-site
Made a website which has login, logout, signup feature.
Also you can do post on it, delete that post also.

We've "default" user. He can do post and able to delete its own post only!

We've "mod" user. He can delete anyones post, but not able to ban anyone.

We also have a "superuser". He can BAN user, after which that user will not able to do post. And delete anyones post also.

I've user Django for backend. And normal HTML, CSS, very little JavaScript.
