# Django-forum-site
Made a website which has login, logout, signup feature.
Also you can do post on it, delete that post also.

We've "mod" user. He can delete anyones post.

We also have a "superuser". He can ban user also, after which that user will not able to do post.

I've user Django for backend. And normal HTML, CSS, very little JavaScript.
